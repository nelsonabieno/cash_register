# Amenitiz Cash Register
## Description
An interactive command line cash register application that receives product items from user and calculates the total price. 

### Assumptions

**Products Registered**
| Product Code | Name | Price |  
|--|--|--|
| GR1 |  Green Tea | 3.11€ |
| SR1 |  Strawberries | 5.00 € |
| CF1 |  Coffee | 11.23 € |

**Special conditions**

- The CEO is a big fan of buy-one-get-one-free offers and green tea.
  He wants us to add a  rule to do this.

- The COO, though, likes low prices and wants people buying strawberries to get a price  discount for bulk purchases.
  If you buy 3 or more strawberries, the price should drop to 4.50€.

- The VP of Engineering is a coffee addict.
  If you buy 3 or more coffees, the price of all coffees should drop to 2/3 of the original price.

Our check-out can scan items in any order, and because the CEO and COO change their minds  often, it needs to be flexible regarding our pricing rules.

**Test data**
| Basket | Total price expected |  
|--|--|
| GR1,GR1 |  3.11€ |
| SR1,SR1,GR1,SR1 |  16.61€ |   (3*4.5)= 13.5 + 3.11 = 16.61
| GR1,CF1,SR1,CF1,CF1 |  30.57€ |
